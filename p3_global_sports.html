      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
        <p>Junior NBA was looking for a primary vendor to manage its digital assets, maintain and strategise the website content and the Facebook pages in the regions of &#45; Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p><br />

        <p>They presented us with the challenge of creating a new generation of NBA fans by increasing fan acquisition and engagement among youth in the age groups of 10&#45;14 years old who are interested in basketball.</p><br />

        <p>We needed to make sure and convince them that we have the necessary skills and resources to provide high quality results.

      <h2>My Role & Process</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
        <p>I was the head of research for the content department. My role was to gather content and statistics so that we could best represent the service that we can offer in order to maximise our opportunity of winning the business.</p><br />

        <p>After gathering the statistics, we decided the best way to represent it was through an infographic. As I have never done infographics before, I needed to research how best to construct it. I prioritised the statistics that I would use within the infographic and agreed on the tone of voice and imagery we wanted to show.</p><br />

        <p>My initial approach was to create sketches of the infographic layout, which I tested with my peers in the data and analytics department. Once I was happy with the content and the layout approach, I created a low-fidelity version of the infographic.</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
        <p>After I created the low-fi version, I went through a second round of testing to further validate my design approach. After a few tweaks to the content and layout, it was ready to apply the final visual look and feel.</p><br />

        <p>I laid out the statistics and figures for this demographic of fans (10-14 year olds) in a visually appealing manner to identify content opportunities: the level of sports consumption online, the most engaging type of sports content on social media, the most popular types of channels for sports discussion, and the most meaningful type of off-season content.</p>
